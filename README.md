This map of campgrounds that are within a 3 hour drive of NYC was created for my Web Mapping course at NYU Wagner.

As someone who enjoys weekend getaways from the city to camp and commune with nature, I've been unimpressed with the available online campground directories.I created this map for ther NYCers who are looking to find nearby campgrounds for a weekend getaway. The campgrounds included are those that offer drive-up tent sites.

The map filters focus on my main concerns when finding a campground:
-Distance from NYC: Can I drive there after work on a Friday and have time to start a fire and pitch my tent before it gets dark?
-Pet-friendly: Can I bring my dog?
-Showers: Can I take a shower after hiking?
