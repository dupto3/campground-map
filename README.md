This map of campgrounds that are within a 3 hour drive of NYC was created for my Web Mapping course at NYU Wagner.

As someone who enjoys weekend getaways from the city to camp / commune with nature, I've been unimpressed with the available online campground directories. 

This map focuses on my main concerns when identifying a campground:
-Distance from NYC: can I drive there after work on a Friday and have time to start a fire and pitch my tent before it gets dark?
-Pet-friendly: 
-Flush Toilets: 
-Showers: 

I created this map for other NYCers who are looking to find nearby campgrounds for a weekend getaway. The campgrounds are filtered using a dropdown that driving time from NYC.
